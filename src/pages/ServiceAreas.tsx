              South Florida house cleaning, done by people who actually live here
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              TIDYWISE was founded by a Deerfield Beach family who got tired of dealing
              with no-show cleaners, surprise upcharges, and out-of-state booking
              services. We started with a single team, a 50-point quality checklist, and
              a promise: every TIDYWISE clean is performed by background-checked,
              W-2 employees — never gig workers — and we re-clean for free if you're
              ever unhappy. That standard now covers more than 40 cities across Broward,
              Palm Beach, and Miami-Dade counties, and every one of those cities is
              served by cleaners who know the area, the HOAs, the gate codes, and the
              specific challenges of cleaning a home in the South Florida climate.

              What we mean by "South-Florida-specific cleaning"
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Cleaning in South Florida isn't the same as cleaning anywhere else. Our
              cleaners are trained on the things that matter here: salt-air corrosion on
              chrome and stainless, mildew prevention in shower grout (year-round
              humidity makes it constant), pollen and mold counts that spike during
              storm season, post-storm debris cleanup, hardwood-floor care in 70%+
              indoor humidity, sliding glass door tracks that fill with sand, lanai
              and pool deck pressure-washing, and the seasonal turnover dynamics of
              snowbird condos and Airbnb vacation rentals. Whether you're in a Mizner
              Park condo, a Weston single-family, an Airbnb on Hollywood Beach, or a
              high-rise in Sunny Isles, the team that arrives is trained on the
              specific challenges of your property type.

    q: "What does a move-out cleaning in Fort Lauderdale include?",
    a: "A move-out clean is a top-to-bottom deep clean designed to return a property to inspection-ready condition. It includes inside the oven, refrigerator and cabinets, full bathroom scrub-downs, baseboards, blinds, window sills, interior windows, closets, and floors throughout. The goal is to meet landlord or property-manager standards so you recover your full security deposit.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does move-out cleaning cost in Fort Lauderdale?",
    a: "TIDYWISE move-in/move-out cleaning starts at $300 and scales with home size and condition. A typical 2–3 bedroom apartment or home in Fort Lauderdale runs $300–$600. You'll get an exact, transparent quote online in minutes — no in-home estimate needed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will a professional move-out clean help me get my deposit back?",
    a: "Yes — cleaning is one of the most common reasons landlords withhold deposits. A professional, inspection-ready clean addresses the exact areas property managers check (appliances, bathrooms, baseboards, floors). Many tenants find the cost of cleaning is far less than the deposit they'd otherwise lose.",
  },
  {
    q: "When should I schedule my move-out cleaning?",
    a: "Book your clean for after your furniture and belongings are removed but before your final walk-through — ideally on your last day or the day before keys are due. Please note TIDYWISE does not offer same-day or next-day bookings, so schedule at least two days ahead to lock in your slot.",

            <p>
              Florida landlords and property managers in Broward County inspect a rental against its
              move-in condition before returning a deposit. Cleaning is the single most common reason
              deductions happen — a unit that looks "lived in" rather than "move-in ready" can cost you
              hundreds of dollars. This checklist walks every room so nothing gets missed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Work top to bottom in each room (ceilings and fixtures first, floors last) and tackle the
              kitchen and bathrooms most thoroughly, since those areas get scrutinized hardest. If you'd
              rather skip the labor entirely during an already-stressful move, TIDYWISE offers
              inspection-ready move-out cleaning across Fort Lauderdale and all of Broward County.

                <strong className="text-foreground">Photograph everything.</strong> Take dated photos of
                every cleaned room before you hand over keys. This documentation is your best defense if a
                landlord disputes the condition later.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-foreground">Clean after the truck leaves.</strong> Cleaning an empty
                unit is faster and far more thorough — scuffs and dust hidden behind furniture become
                visible. Schedule your clean for after the move, before the final walk-through.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-foreground">Don't forget the small stuff.</strong> Switch plates,
                door frames, blinds, and inside the oven are the details inspectors notice most. A
                professional move-out clean covers all of them automatically.

            <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why Miramar Homes Need Professional Cleaning</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Miramar's planned communities were built with large families in mind — homes here routinely have 4–5 bedrooms, multiple bathrooms, tile throughout, and screen-enclosed pools. At this size and complexity, keeping a home genuinely clean between professional visits is a significant undertaking.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              South Florida's year-round humidity means dust, mold spores, and allergens accumulate faster than in drier climates. Regular professional cleaning isn't just about appearance — it's about maintaining indoor air quality in a climate that actively works against it.

                { t: "Consistent teams", b: "Miramar's bi-weekly clients benefit most from the same team every visit. You don't re-explain your preferences, and your cleaners learn what matters most in your specific home." },

                { t: "Transparent online pricing", b: "Legitimate services publish their rates online. If a company won't quote without an in-home visit, expect the price to be higher than what transparent services charge." },

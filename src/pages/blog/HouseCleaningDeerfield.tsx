            <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why Deerfield Beach Homes Need Professional Cleaning</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Deerfield Beach's coastal location creates specific cleaning challenges. Salt air from the Atlantic deposits residue on windows, screens, and metal surfaces faster than inland areas. The city's mix of beachfront condos, waterfront canal homes, and established neighborhoods means properties face different challenges depending on location.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Century Village and other active adult communities here have steady demand for reliable recurring cleaning — residents want a trustworthy team they can count on, not a different crew every time. TIDYWISE assigns consistent teams to recurring clients.

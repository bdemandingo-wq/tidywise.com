            <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why Fort Lauderdale Homes Need Regular Professional Cleaning</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              South Florida's humidity and heat accelerate dust, mold growth, and allergen buildup faster than in drier climates. Fort Lauderdale homes near the water also deal with salt air — which can leave residue on surfaces and accelerate wear.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Professional cleaning every 2–4 weeks removes allergens, prevents mold on grout and tile, and keeps your home in the condition South Florida's real estate market demands. Many Fort Lauderdale Airbnb and vacation rental hosts book TIDYWISE for same-day turnovers.

            <h2 className="font-display text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why Weston Homes Need Professional Cleaning</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Weston's large planned communities come with large homes — most in the 3,000–5,000+ square foot range. At this size, keeping a home genuinely clean requires more than a quick pass with a vacuum. Tile throughout, screen-enclosed pools, multiple bathrooms, and open-plan living areas all accumulate South Florida's humidity-driven dust and buildup faster than smaller homes.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Many Weston homeowners also have live-in help or young families — making eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning products non-negotiable. TIDYWISE uses eco-certified products that are safe for children, pets, and the premium surfaces found in Weston's luxury homes.

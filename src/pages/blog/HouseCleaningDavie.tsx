  {
    q: "Do you clean equestrian and ranch properties in Davie?",
    a: "Yes. TIDYWISE understands the specific cleaning challenges of Davie's ranch-style and equestrian properties — heavy tracking from outdoor living areas, barn dust, and the large open-plan interiors typical of ranch homes. We clean properties throughout Davie's agricultural and equestrian corridors."

    q: "How often should Davie homeowners book professional cleaning?",

              House Cleaning in Davie, FL — Ranch Homes, Equestrian Properties & From $108
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-8">
              Davie is unlike any other Broward County city — a community that maintained its agricultural and equestrian character even as South Florida urbanized around it. Ranch-style homes, horse properties, and large suburban lots sit alongside newer planned communities. Cleaning here has specific requirements that a standard suburban service may not anticipate. Here's what Davie homeowners need to know.

      {
        q: "What cleaning services do you offer?",
        a: "We offer Standard Cleaning, Deep Cleaning, and Move In/Out Cleaning for residential properties. Our services include dusting, vacuuming, mopping, bathroom sanitization, kitchen cleaning, and more. We also offer add-ons like inside oven, inside refrigerator, and window cleaning."
      },
      {
        q: "What's the difference between Standard and Deep Cleaning?",
        a: "Standard Cleaning is your regular maintenance clean—perfect for homes that are already in good condition. Deep Cleaning is more thorough and includes detailed cleaning of baseboards, inside cabinets, light fixtures, and areas often missed during regular cleaning. We recommend starting with a Deep Clean, then switching to Standard for maintenance."
      },
      {
        q: "Do you bring your own cleaning supplies?",
        a: "Yes! Our team arrives fully equipped with professional-grade, eco-friendly cleaning supplies and equipment. If you prefer we use specific products (due to allergies or preferences), just let us know when booking."
      },
      {
        q: "Do you offer commercial cleaning?",
        a: "Yes! We offer both residential and commercial cleaning services. Contact us to discuss your commercial cleaning needs and get a custom quote."

      },
      {
        q: "How long does a cleaning take?",
        a: "Cleaning time depends on your home size and the type of service. Standard cleaning for a 3-bedroom home typically takes 2-3 hours. Deep cleaning takes 4-6 hours. We'll give you an estimate when you book."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Pricing & Payment",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "How much does cleaning cost?",
        a: "Pricing depends on your home size, number of bathrooms, and the type of service. Standard cleaning for a 3-bedroom home starts around $160-$220. Deep cleaning is typically 1.5-2x more. Use our online calculator for an instant estimate!"

      },
      {
        q: "What payment methods do you accept?",
        a: "We accept all major credit cards, debit cards, and digital payments. Payment is collected after the cleaning is complete and you're satisfied with our work."
      },
      {
        q: "Are there any hidden fees?",
        a: "No hidden fees! The price we quote is the price you pay. If your cleaning requires significantly more work than expected, we'll discuss it with you first before any additional charges."

  {
    category: "Trust & Safety",
    questions: [
      {

      }
    ]

  {
    category: "Preparation & Pets",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "Do I need to be home during the cleaning?",
        a: "You don't have to be! Many clients provide a key, lockbox code, or garage code. Just let us know your preference when booking. If you're home, we'll work around you."
      },
      {
        q: "What should I do before the cleaners arrive?",
        a: "Light tidying helps us focus on cleaning rather than organizing. Put away personal items and valuables, clear dishes from the sink, and let us know about any areas needing special attention. Check our blog for detailed prep tips!"
      },
      {
        q: "Do you clean homes with pets?",
        a: "Absolutely! We love pets. Just let us know about your furry friends when booking so we can be prepared. If you have an anxious or aggressive pet, please secure them in a safe area during the cleaning."

        q: "Can I reschedule my cleaning?",
        a: "Yes! You can reschedule with at least 24 hours notice at no charge. Just call us at (561) 571-8725 or reply to your confirmation email."
      },
      {
        q: "What if my cleaner can't make it?",

  { q: "Are your cleaners background-checked?", a: "Yes! Every TIDYWISE cleaner undergoes a thorough background check, is fully insured, and goes through our professional training program before their first assignment." },
  { q: "Do I need to be home during the cleaning?", a: "No, many of our clients provide a spare key or door code. We're fully insured and bonded, so your home is protected. You can also be home if you prefer." },
  { q: "What cleaning products do you use?", a: "We use eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning products that are safe for children, pets, and the environment. If you have specific product preferences or allergies, let us know and we'll accommodate." },
  { q: "What's your cancellation policy?", a: "We ask for at least 24 hours notice for cancellations. Same-day cancellations may be subject to a fee. We understand things come up, so we're always flexible and understanding." },
  { q: "Do you offer recurring cleaning discounts?", a: "Absolutely! Weekly service saves 15%, bi-weekly saves 10%, and monthly saves 5%. The more frequently you book, the more you save." },

A deep clean includes all of that PLUS baseboards, inside cabinets, light fixtures, door handles, window sills, and all add-on services." },

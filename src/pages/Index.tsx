  { q: "What cleaning products do you use?", a: "We use eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning products that are safe for children, pets, and the environment. If you have specific product preferences or allergies, let us know and we'll accommodate." },
  { q: "What's your cancellation policy?", a: "We ask for at least 24 hours notice for cancellations. Same-day cancellations may be subject to a fee. We understand things come up, so we're always flexible and understanding." },

A deep clean includes all of that PLUS baseboards, inside cabinets, light fixtures, door handles, window sills, and all add-on services." },

  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to be home during the cleaning?",
    a: "No, many of our clients provide a spare key or door code. We're fully insured and bonded, so your home is protected. You can also be home if you prefer — whatever makes you comfortable.",

    a: "We use eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning products that are safe for children, pets, and the environment. If you have specific product preferences or allergies, let us know and we'll accommodate.",

  {
    q: "Do you offer recurring cleaning discounts?",
    a: "Absolutely! Weekly service saves 15%, bi-weekly saves 10%, and monthly saves 5%. The more frequently you book, the more you save — and your home stays consistently clean.",
